# Flight_Price_Prediction
Project Overview
This project aims to predict the prices of airline tickets using various machine learning techniques. Accurate flight price predictions can help travelers plan their trips more efficiently and save money by booking at the optimal time. The project utilizes historical flight data and various features such as departure date, airline, source, destination, and more to forecast future prices.

Features
Data Collection: Gathered historical flight price data from multiple sources.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and processed the data to handle missing values, categorical variables, and feature scaling.
Feature Engineering: Created new features that enhance the prediction accuracy.
Modeling: Implemented various regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized model performance using techniques like Grid Search and Random Search.
Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Deployment: Created a user-friendly interface to input flight details and get price predictions.
